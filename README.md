# Processing-ambiguous-comparatives-in-Kor

(Under construction)

The sentence completion, sentence comprehension, eye-tracker data and R scripts for 'Processing ambiguous comparative constructions in Korean', with a summary of the thesis in English. This is from my master's thesis project.

# Introduction

Consider the sentence below:

(1) Keira likes Rachel more than Michelle.

(1) is ambiguous since the sentence could be interpreted in two ways. That is, either Keira likes Rachel more than Michelle likes Rachel, or Keira likes Rachel more than she likes Michelle. In other words, Michelle in (1) could be either Subject (Experiencer) or Object (Theme).
